# Preparation

So today is the day, the day we leave behind civilization to live in a cramped, inconvenient space for the foreseeable future. Goodbye, cruel world.

However, I don't quite see it that dramatically, I see it as an opportunity for the 4 of us to spend time together before we have children who no longer
want to spend time with their parents, all while learning some things about the world around us (ok, central oregon for the time being....technically that's part of the world!).

Over the past month we've made some big changes to prepare us for this trip:

- The kids have started homeschooling
- I've planned our first destination extensively
- Julie has made sure the RV is livable (or at least as comfortable as possible)

Those might sound like some small or easy tasks but they have led to some serious stress around the house.
And, 3 of 4 of us do not deal with stress well...yikes.

Anyway, the day is here. The RV is packed and we're on our way!

## The Drive

We're heading to Sisters/Bend area for the first leg!

As we drive off I am told that Ski Bowl just had 3 inches of snow the day before...and I'm towing this large trailer...I'm not sure exactly what to expect.
But, we get to the top of the pass on Mt. Hood and it's absolutely awesome, clear roads, no wind. We couldn't ask for better conditions.

As you probably know, the drive over Mt. Hood, down through Warmsprings, and in to Bend is absolutely awesome.
We were very fortunate to have amazing weather which added to the stunning nature of the drive.

Of course, the drive would not be complete without a few choice curse words. After being diverted by Google Maps
into a well manicured residential area, complete with narrow roads and windy turns we were taken to a road that is
closed for construction with no real ability to turn around. After getting out of the truck, and "walking it off" the solution was to venture forward down a 
rocky, unpaved road...success. Next, I miss the turn for the RV park, only to find a turnaround big enough for a smart car to 
make a u-turn...no problem for a 60' monstrocity.

After what seemed like 3 very short hours we've arrived at our first destination.

## Bend/Sisters Garden RV Resort

For starters, the park is awesome. It's a very flat, well maintained facility, set amongst the cascade mountains, pine trees, 
and many open fields.

I chose this RV park based on the location (between Sisters and Bend), the beauty of the pictures on their website,
and a conversation I had with their front desk about the state of their wifi...the result of which was something like 
'it's pretty bad, but if I put you near the office you should get the best connection'. Ok, awesome, good enough to 
work from, and ge the kids completing their home school work. Internet, quite literally, is controlling our lives at the moment.

We park, setup the RV, and immediately get to the task of visiting fast.com to see what speed internet we're dealing with...
oh. my. god. it's the slowest damn thing in the world...and that's when it connects! This is going to be an extremely
interesting 2 weeks if it's impossible to work from our mobile residence. This is something I'll need to deal with in the very near future...

Time to take a look at our surroundings. We took Princess (our mascot) for a walk in the dog park which happens to double as a
fairgrounds for the Sisters Rodeo. We also, take a look around the park itself, it's pretty cool...you can tell there are lots of retired
folks staying here long term, there is a man made lake in the middle of the park with ducks and a spray fountain...I immediately wonder if I can
dive in, however, hypothermia is not on the agenda for today.

We also took a short trip through downtown Sisters to take stock of places we'll be sure to visit.

This is the first day of our adventure, and if it is any indication, it should be a pretty awesome trip.
