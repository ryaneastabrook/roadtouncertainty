# How this mess all started

Last winter we purchased a travel trailer after many many months of debate and conversations with my wife. I was saying thing like 'we need this thing or we'll die'
and she was saying things like 'you're an idiot'...needless to say, we were both right, and we welcomed a 30' monstrocity into our lives.

Neither one of us had spent time in a travel trailer before and we weren't even sure it was something we'd like to do. However, I knew a couple things: 1) I love to camp 
2) My wife said she woudn't camp with me if she had to sleep in the dirt (it's a vinyl floor 2 bedroom tent, but I let it slide)
